# AI Hallucination Prevention & Data Enhancement Plan
*Comprehensive strategy to ground Dartmouth opportunities AI and prevent false information*

## Overview
Your platform has solid RAG infrastructure but needs enhanced grounding mechanisms and real-time data access to prevent hallucinations about Dartmouth-specific details (program names, deadlines, contact info, etc.).

## Phase 1: Enhanced Data Collection & Validation (Browserbase Integration) 🚀
**Primary Goal**: Use Browserbase to expand opportunity database and validate/fix existing links

### 1.1 Browserbase Implementation
- [ ] Integrate Browserbase for automated web scraping of Dartmouth opportunities
- [ ] Enhance existing Playwright scraper with Browserbase infrastructure
- [ ] Add real-time link validation and opportunity data updates
- [ ] Implement scheduled scraping to keep data current

### 1.2 Data Quality Improvements
- [ ] Add URL status tracking and automated link validation
- [ ] Implement data freshness indicators and last-verified timestamps
- [ ] Create opportunity data enrichment pipeline
- [ ] Add source attribution and verification metadata

### 1.3 Casual, Direct Language Processing
- [ ] Extract opportunities with straightforward descriptions: "You can get $5,000 to build your startup"
- [ ] Avoid embellishment - focus on raw facts: amounts, what you can do, how to apply
- [ ] Implement content parsing that captures: funding amounts, time commitments, application processes

## Phase 2: AI Response Grounding & Hallucination Prevention 🛡️
**Primary Goal**: Implement multi-layered hallucination prevention using 2025 best practices

### 2.1 Real-Time Web Search Integration (Tavily)
- [ ] Add Tavily AI search tool for real-time Dartmouth information
- [ ] Configure search to focus on official Dartmouth domains
- [ ] Implement search result validation and confidence scoring
- [ ] Add fallback search capabilities for current information

### 2.2 Enhanced RAG Boundaries
- [ ] Implement strict "source attribution required" prompting
- [ ] Add confidence calibration to AI responses
- [ ] Create "uncertainty acknowledgment" patterns
- [ ] Implement response validation layer with disclaimers

### 2.3 Guardrail System Implementation
- [ ] Add automated fact-checking modules for Dartmouth-specific claims
- [ ] Implement response flagging for unverified details
- [ ] Create "escape hatch" mechanisms when information is uncertain
- [ ] Add human-in-the-loop validation for critical information

## Phase 3: Advanced Browser Automation (Stagehand) 🤖
**Primary Goal**: Implement reliable, AI-assisted data extraction for complex pages

### 3.1 Stagehand Integration
- [ ] Replace static scraper with Stagehand for adaptive web automation
- [ ] Implement intelligent page navigation and data extraction
- [ ] Add schema-based structured data extraction
- [ ] Create robust error handling for changing website structures

### 3.2 Intelligent Content Processing
- [ ] Implement semantic understanding of opportunity pages
- [ ] Add automatic categorization and metadata extraction
- [ ] Create content validation and quality scoring
- [ ] Implement duplicate detection and data deduplication

## Phase 4: Response Enhancement & User Trust 🎯
**Primary Goal**: Build user confidence through transparency and accuracy

### 4.1 Source Transparency
- [ ] Always include "Source:" attribution in responses
- [ ] Add "Last verified:" timestamps to opportunity information
- [ ] Implement "Confirm details on official pages" disclaimers
- [ ] Create clear distinction between verified and inferred information

### 4.2 Confidence Indicators
- [ ] Add confidence scores to AI responses
- [ ] Implement uncertainty language patterns
- [ ] Create "I don't have current information about..." responses
- [ ] Add suggestions for official verification sources

## Phase 5: Monitoring & Continuous Improvement 📊
**Primary Goal**: Maintain system reliability and accuracy over time

### 5.1 Hallucination Detection System
- [ ] Implement automated hallucination detection using LLM prompts
- [ ] Add semantic similarity validation against known data
- [ ] Create user feedback loops for accuracy reporting
- [ ] Implement continuous monitoring of response quality

### 5.2 Data Quality Monitoring
- [ ] Add automated data freshness monitoring
- [ ] Implement broken link detection and reporting
- [ ] Create data quality dashboards for admin oversight
- [ ] Add user-reported corrections system

## Implementation Priority & Timeline

### 🔥 IMMEDIATE (Week 1-2)
1. **Enhanced prompting** with strict grounding requirements
2. **Browserbase setup** for data collection
3. **Link validation** for existing opportunities

### ⚡ SHORT-TERM (Week 3-4)
1. **Real data scraping** with Browserbase
2. **Casual language processing** - extract straightforward descriptions
3. **Data quality pipeline** - freshness indicators, source attribution

### 🎯 MEDIUM-TERM (Month 2)
1. **Tavily search integration** for real-time info
2. **Guardrail systems** for response validation
3. **Source transparency** in AI responses

### 🚀 LONG-TERM (Month 3+)
1. **Stagehand implementation** for advanced automation
2. **Continuous monitoring** systems
3. **Advanced hallucination detection**

## Expected Outcomes
- **Reduced hallucinations** by 80-90% through multi-layered prevention
- **Enhanced data quality** with real-time validation and updates
- **Improved user trust** through transparent source attribution
- **Maintained helpfulness** while ensuring accuracy
- **More opportunities** with direct, casual language descriptions

## Tools & Technologies Stack
- **Browserbase**: Scalable headless browser infrastructure
- **Tavily API**: AI-first web search for current information
- **Stagehand**: Intelligent browser automation (future)
- **Enhanced prompting**: Strict grounding and uncertainty handling
- **Automated monitoring**: Continuous quality assurance

## Success Metrics
- Number of opportunities in database (target: 2x current)
- Link validation accuracy (target: >95%)
- User reports of hallucinated information (target: <5%)
- AI response confidence scores (target: >0.8 average)
- Data freshness (target: <30 days average age)
