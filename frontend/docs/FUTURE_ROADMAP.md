# Future Roadmap: Wall of Advice Feature

## Overview üìù
The "Wall of Advice" will be a Pinterest-style page where Dartmouth students share their experiences, tips, and advice about discovering opportunities on campus.

## Vision üéØ
Create a community-driven platform where students can learn from each other's journeys, mistakes, and successes. This feature aims to build confidence and provide actionable insights from peer experiences.

## Content Strategy üí°

### Types of Advice Posts:
1. **Success Stories**
   - "How I got my first research position"
   - "From undeclared to dream internship"
   - "My path to the Dickey Center fellowship"

2. **Practical Tips**
   - "Best email templates for reaching out to professors"
   - "What I wish I knew before applying to study abroad"
   - "Time management tips for balancing research and coursework"

3. **Encouragement & Mindset**
   - "Why rejection letters aren't the end"
   - "Imposter syndrome is real (and how I dealt with it)"
   - "It's okay to change your path"

4. **Specific Program Insights**
   - "What the D-Plan Internship really taught me"
   - "Life as an international student at Dartmouth"
   - "First-gen student resources I discovered"

### Content Sources:
- **Student Interviews**: Reach out to successful upperclassmen
- **Alumni Stories**: Recent grads sharing their journeys
- **Community Submissions**: Form for students to share their own advice
- **Faculty Insights**: Professors sharing student success stories
- **Program Coordinators**: Tips from people who run key programs

## Technical Implementation üõ†Ô∏è

### Database Schema (Add to existing Convex schema):
```typescript
// Add to convex/schema.ts
advicePosts: defineTable({
  title: v.string(),
  content: v.string(),
  authorName: v.string(),
  authorYear: v.optional(v.string()),
  authorMajor: v.optional(v.string()),
  category: v.string(), // "research", "internships", "study-abroad", "general", etc.
  tags: v.array(v.string()),
  isAnonymous: v.boolean(),
  isApproved: v.boolean(),
  featured: v.boolean(),
  likes: v.number(),
  createdAt: v.number(),
})
.index("by_category", ["category"])
.index("by_approved", ["isApproved"])
.index("by_featured", ["featured"])
```

### UI Components to Build:
1. **AdviceCard**: Pinterest-style card with hover effects
2. **AdviceGrid**: Masonry layout for cards
3. **AdviceFilters**: Filter by category, year, etc.
4. **AdviceSubmissionForm**: For community contributions
5. **AdviceDetail**: Full post view with comments

### Design Inspiration:
